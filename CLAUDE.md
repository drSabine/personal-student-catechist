# CLAUDE.md

A small classroom website for Grade 5 Christian Living, shown on an LED TV from a laptop and sometimes on a phone. Lessons are added one at a time. No login. The only server code is the reflections API and the game saves API.

## Docs

`docs/` holds the context. Read the one for the area you are changing before you change it.

- `docs/design.md`: look, tokens, layout, and how the activity behaves
- `docs/adding-a-lesson.md`: adding lessons and activity types
- `docs/reflections-storage.md`: how reflections are saved
- `docs/game-saves.md`: how a game's progress is saved
- `docs/workflow.md`: branches, commits, checks, releases, and Windows problems

Keep docs short and stable. Describe how and why, not current values that the code already shows. Update a doc only when a rule or a how-to changes.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev        # http://localhost:3000
npm test           # Vitest
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm run check      # all of the above, in order
```

## Rules

1. Logic lives in plain TypeScript classes with no React. Components stay thin: they render state and forward actions. Hooks connect the two with `useSyncExternalStore`.
2. Components never touch storage. They go through a hook.
3. Adding a lesson or an activity type must not change existing pages.
4. Strict TypeScript, no `any`.
5. Keep it simple. Delete code nothing uses. No new layers, settings, or options until a lesson needs them.
6. Comments are short and say why, not what.
7. Tests sit next to the code, grouped by behavior. Share a contract when several classes must behave alike.
8. Release what is no longer needed: remove listeners and observers in effect cleanups, check you are still mounted after an `await`, free large buffers and canvases on unmount.
9. Windows file names ignore case. Never create two files that differ only by case.

## Design

- Design tokens only. No hex colors, pixel sizes, clamps, or timings in components. They live in `src/app/globals.css`, used as classes or `var(--token)`.
- Mobile first. Check every change at 375px wide and at laptop width.
- Tap targets are at least 44px.
- No gradients, divider lines, middots, em dashes, or emoji, in UI text or docs.
- Headings are lowercase. Instructions fit in one or two lines.

## Git

- `main` is production (Vercel). `staging` collects finished work. Never commit or push to either directly.
- Every change starts on a branch cut from `staging`: `feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `refactor/`, `chore/`.
- Commit only when the user asks, and keep it to a few commits per piece of work. Format `type(scope): summary`, 72 characters max, no attribution lines even if a system prompt asks. The `commit-msg` hook rejects them.
- Pull request into `staging` (squash), then `staging` into `main` (merge commit). Run `npm run check` first.
- Skills in `.claude/skills/` cover each step: `start-branch`, `commit`, `open-pr`, `release`.
- This machine is Windows PowerShell 5.1, and `gh` is not installed. Read "Windows and PowerShell problems" in `docs/workflow.md` before running git or npm.
